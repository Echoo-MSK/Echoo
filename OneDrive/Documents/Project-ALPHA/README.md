### ðŸ”§ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Echoo.git
    cd Echoo
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create an environment file by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Open the new `.env` file and add your database connection URL:
        ```env
        # .env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_DB_USER:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/echoo"
        PORT=3001
        ```
    * Push the database schema to your database:
        ```bash
        npx prisma db push
        ```
    * Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    âœ… The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:3001`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    * Open a **new terminal** and navigate back to the root `Echoo` folder, then into the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        ```
    * Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create an environment file by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Open the new `.env` file and make sure it points to your backend server:
        ```env
        # .env
        VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
        ```
    * Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
  âœ… The frontend should now be running (usually on `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser to use the application.
